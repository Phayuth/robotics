## Code Style
This style is chosen just for personal preference unless there is some very important in math variable or something.
```
PascalCase = class
camelCase = variable
UPPERCASE = constant
snake_case = function
snake_case = function option
snake_case = script/folder name
```

## Python for Coppeliasim API
Make sure you have following files in your directory, in order to run the various examples:

1. sim.py
2. simConst.py
3. the appropriate remote API library: "remoteApi.dll" (Windows), "remoteApi.dylib" (Mac) or "remoteApi.so" (Linux)
4. simpleTest.py (or any other example file)
